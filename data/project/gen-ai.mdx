# Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into business operations to assist humans in a wide range of open-ended tasks, including ones that require creativity. While the flexibility of LLM unlocked new ways of how human collaborates with AI, it also leads to uncertainties and whether LLMs can truly enhance business outcomes in these tasks remains unclear. To examine the effects of human-LLM collaboration on business outcomes, we conducted an online experiment enrolling 355 participants who were tasked with writing an ad copy.

Specifically, we investigate and compare two ways of working with LLMs: (1) using LLMs as "ghostwriters", which assume the content generation task and (2) using LLMs as "sounding boards", which provide feedback based on human-created content. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one-third worked independently without LLM; one-third uses a custom-developed GPT-4-based chatbot as ghostwriters; and the final third crafted ad copies on their own while using the chatbot as a sounding board. 

Our results show that the two human-LLM collaboration modalities led to differential effects. Using LLMs as sounding boards yields an overall positive effect on the business outcomes of the resultant ad copies, especially for non-experts. However, the usage of LLMs as ghostwriters did not provide significant benefits and is detrimental to expert users.
