# Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid open-ended creative tasks, but their impact on task outcomes, particularly in human-AI collaborative settings, remains unclear. We investigate two ways of working with LLMs in marketing: using an LLM to generate ad copy and using an LLM to provide writing feedback. We conducted an online experiment, enrolling 355 incentivized participants, who were tasked with writing an ad copy. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: one-third worked independently; one-third utilized an LLM chatbot (GPT-4) to generate ad copies; and the final third employed the same chatbot to provide writing feedback. The experimental results show that the use of LLM in generating advertisement copy led to mixed results, with benefits varying based on user expertise and collaboration modality. Laypersons benefited from LLM for seeking feedback, closing the performance gap with experienced marketers. However, usage of LLM for direct content generation did not provide significant benefit, and is detrimental to expert users.
