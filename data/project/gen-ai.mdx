# Abstract

Since the launch of ChatGPT in Dec 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by businesses to assist users in a wide range of open-ended tasks, including ones that require creativity. While the flexibility of LLM unlocked new ways of human-AI collaboration, it remains uncertain whether LLMs can truly enhance business outcomes. To examine the effects of human-LLM collaboration on business outcomes, we conducted an experiment where we task both expert and non-expert users to write an ad copy with and without the assistance of LLMs. Here, we investigate and compare two ways of working with LLMs:

 1. using LLMs as “ghostwriters,” which assume the main role of content generation task and
 2. using LLMs as “sounding boards,” to provide feedback based on human-created content.
 
 Our results show that the two human-LLM collaboration modalities can have very different outcomes. Using LLMs as sounding boards yields an overall positive effect, by enhancing the quality of the resultant ad copies, especially for non-experts. However, using LLMs as ghostwriters did not provide significant benefits and is in fact detrimental to expert users. Finally, we learn that the proper use of LLMs can close the gap between experts and non-experts.
